Bharagavi ‘s SOP  Draft1 : 
uncertainty loomed over my career during my High School, I was thrown into the world of Computers not by choice. Through college the concepts I was introduced to didn’t fail to  intrigue me with every passing day. With every project I built and contribution I made to Open Source, I felt I was on the right path. This path has lead me to apply for Computer Science, M.S. program at NYU, as this would give me the much needed exposure and skills to develop even better software.
